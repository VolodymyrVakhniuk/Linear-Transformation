## Project Description ##
The goal of the project is to enhance the visual understanding of *linear transformations* - a fundamental linear algebra concept. The user has to input the necessary information (basis vectors and matrix), hit the play button and will immediately see the animation of the *linear transformation*. The project was created for the SoME1 (Summer of Math Exposition) event launched by Grant Sanderson in August 2020. I created this project together with my friend. My responsibilities:
 1) visualization engine using p5.js.
 2) visualization engine API using Javascript. In order to “communicate” with the rest of the program.
 3) Brief instructions on using the project.
 4) Supplementary math articles.

## Tools Used ## 
 1) HTML 
 1) CSS
 2) Javascript
 4) p5.js
